# About QP-nano
QP-nano (Quantum Platform Nano) is an ultra-lightweight, open source software
framework/RTOS for building reactvie real-time embedded applications
as systems of cooperating, event-driven active objects (actors). The
QP-nano framework is a member of a larger [QP] family consisting of
QP/C, QP/C++, and QP-nano frameworks, which are all strictly quality
controlled, thoroughly documented, and commercially licensable.

## Safer Model of Concurrency
The [QP] framework family is based on the [Active Object] (**actor**)
design pattern, which inherently supports and automatically enforces the
following best practices of concurrent programming:

- Keep data isolated and bound to active objects' threads. Threads should
hide (**encapsulate**) their private data and other resources, and not
share them with the rest of the system.

- Communicate among active object threads **asynchronously** via event
objects. Using asynchronous events keeps the threads running truly
independently, **without blocking** on each other.

- Active object threads should spend their lifetime responding to incoming
events, so their mainline should consist of an **event-loop** that handles
events one at a time (to completion), thus avoiding any concurrency hazards
within an active object thread itself.

This architecture is generally **safer**, more responsive and easier to
understand and maintain than the shared-state concurrency of a conventional
RTOS. It also provides higher level of abstraction and the right
abstractions to effectively apply **modeling** and **code generation** to
deeply embedded real-time systems.

## Hierarchical State Machines
The behavior of active objects is specified in QP-nano by means of
[Hierarchical State Machines] (UML statecharts). The framework
supports manual coding of UML state machines in C as well as automatic
**code generation** by means of the free [QM] modeling tool.

## Built-in Real-Time Kernels
The QP-nano framework can run on bare-metal single-chip microcontrollers,
completely replacing a traditional "superloop" or an RTOS. The framework
contains a selection of **built-in real-time kernels**, such as the
cooperative QV-nano kernel and the preemptive non-blocking QK-nano kernel.
Native QP-nano ports and ready-to-use examples are provided for such CPUs
MSP430, AVRmega, and ARM Cortex-M (M0/M0+/M3/M4).

## Maturity
With 60,000 downloads a year, the [QP] family is the most popular such
solution on the embedded software market. It provides a modern, reusable
architecture for embedded applications, which combines the active-object
model of concurrency with hierarchical state machines.

# Getting Started with QP-nano
The following "Getting Started with QP-nano" guide provides step-by-step
instructions on how to download, install, and get started with QP-nano quickly:
https://state-machine.com/doc/AN_Getting_Started_with_QP-nano.pdf

The guide also contains a tutorial, in which you build a simple "Blinky"
application.

> NOTE: QP-nano can be unzipped anywhere in your file system, but the
recommended location is `C:\qp\qpn` on Windows and `~/qp/qpn`
on Linux/MacOS.
