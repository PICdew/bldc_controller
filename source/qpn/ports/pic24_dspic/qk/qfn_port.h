/*****************************************************************************
* NOTE01:
* The DISI (disable interrupts) instruction is used for very fast,
* unconditional locking and unlocking of interrupts. The DISI #0x3FFF
* instruction disables interrupts for 16383 instruction cycles, which is
* much longer than any critical section in QP-nano. The DISI #0 instruction
* is then used to unconditionally unlock the interrupts at the end of the
* critical section. The DISI instruction only disables interrupts with
* priority levels 1-6. Priority level 7 interrupts and all trap events still
* have the ability to interrupt the CPU when the DISI instruction is active.
* This means that from the perspective of QP-nano, the level 7 interrupts are
* treated as non-maskable interrupts (NMIs). Such non-maskable interrupts
* _cannot_ call any QP-nano services. In particular, they cannot post events.
*
* CAUTION: This QP-nano port assumes that interrupt nesting is _enabled_,
* which is the default in the PIC24/dsPIC processors. Interrupt nesting should
* never be disabled by setting the NSTDIS control bit (INTCON1<15>). If you
* don't want interrupts to nest, you can always prioritize them at the same
* level. For example, the default priority level for all interrupts is 4 out
* of reset. If you don't change this level for any interrupt the nesting of
* interrupt will not occur.
*
* NOTE02:
* The ISR-level interrupt policy allows interrupt nesting. The QF_ISR_KEY_TYPE
* is _not_ defined, which means that the ISRs will use the task-level
* interrupt locking policy. This is possible, because PIC24/dsPIC CPU does
* _not_ lock interrupts upon entry to the ISR, so the ISR does not constitute
* critical section and the simple critical section incapable of nesting is
* adequate.
*
* CAUTION: This _preemptive_ QK-nano port requires writing ISRs in assembly,
* as shown in the file isr.s. Unfortunately, the ISRs that the C30 compiler
* is capable of generating are not adequate for the QK-nano kernel.
*
* NOTE03:
* The FBCL instruction (Find First Bit Change Left) determines the exponent
* of a value by detecting the first bit change starting from the value�s sign
* bit and working towards the LSB. Since the PIC24/dsPIC�s barrel shifter
* uses negative values to specify a left shift, the FBCL instruction returns
* the negated exponent of a value. This value added to 15 gives the log-2.
